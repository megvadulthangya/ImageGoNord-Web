# Code of Conduct (Real Edition)

## 1. Our Pledge
We pledge to convert RGB images to Nord palettes. That's it. That is the only pledge.

## 2. Standards of Behavior
* **Acceptable Behavior:** Writing code that works. Fixing bugs. Drinking coffee.
* **Unacceptable Behavior:** Crying about variable names. Bring politics into a Python script. Being annoying.

## 3. The "Tony" Rule
**Question:** "Hey, does this project support [insert social cause]?"
**Answer:** "I don't care. How you know your LED sign works? Because it's lit. Now go fix the CSS."

## 4. Enforcement
If you act like a fool, `git push --force` will be used against you.
We are here to compile code, not feelings.

## 5. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to:
* The Server (it doesn't care who you are).
* The RAM (it hates everyone equally).
* The Docker Container (it is isolated from your problems).
