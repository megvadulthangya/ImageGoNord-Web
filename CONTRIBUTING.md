# Contributing to ImageGoNord (Self-Hosted)

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! Since this is a specialized fork for self-hosting, we keep things simple.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Make your changes.** (Fix bugs, optimize code, remove bloat).
3.  **Submit a Pull Request.**

## Guidelines

* **Keep it Clean:** No tracking, no ads, no external dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
* **Keep it Stable:** The goal is to run this on modest hardware (workers=1).
* **No Politics:** We are here for the code, not for social activism.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug:
1.  Check if it's already reported.
2.  Open an issue with details (Docker logs, reproduction steps).
3.  Don't expect 24/7 support – this is a hobby project.

Happy coding!
